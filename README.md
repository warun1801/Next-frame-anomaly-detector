## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Next frame anomaly detector is a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) based implementation of a video frame predictor for anomaly detection. It is mainly used for detecting static anomalies of various kinds. This is due to the various kinds of losses used in the model. 

Losses:

* Optical flow loss
* Adversarial loss
* Intensity loss
* Gradient loss

## Working

The main idea of this is comparing the next predicted (normal) frame with the actual anomalous frame and comparing and thresholding the losses. Each of the loss corresponds to a different kind of anomaly.

## Built With

Built in python. ML frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras were majorly used. An implementation of FlowNet2 was used for calculating the flow of the images.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Get the checkpoints for running the flownet from this [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1An-SCJ06zd94vAV1kphRw1h1Nl6itmYE?usp=sharing)
Download the entire folder and put it in the same directory.

In utils.py
```python
data_dir = "your_folder\\training\\frames"
test_dir = "your_folder\\testing\\frames"
```

In train.py
```python
gan.train(train_gen, epochs=600, batch_size=batch_size, save_interval=200, save_file_name="your_model_name.model")
```

To train:
```sh
python train.py
```
To test:
```sh
python utils.py
```
### Prerequisites

You will need python version 3.6 to run this, since we are using tensorflow 1.
All the requirements are there in requirements.txt

Just do the following to install them:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
